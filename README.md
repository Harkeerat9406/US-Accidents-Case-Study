# US-Accidents-Case-Study
This project provided me valuable insights into how a case study is carried out and allowed me to explore Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  As a beginner project, it features basic graph plots and inferences. Iâ€™m looking forward to tackling more complex projects and deepening my skills in the future!
