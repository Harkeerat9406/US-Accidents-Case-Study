# US-Accidents-Case-Study
This project provided me valuable insights into how a case study is carried out and allowed me to explore Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  As a beginner project, it features basic graph plots and inferences. I’m looking forward to tackling more complex projects and deepening my skills in the future!

DATASET DESCRIPTION
This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.
The dataset contains 500K accident records which is a extracted from a dataset containing around 7.7 million accident records.

The code file is a .ipynb file and can be opened in any code editor. For the best experience, use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code, or Google Colab. If you’re using an editor that doesn’t natively support .ipynb, convert the file to .py.
